      <p>3.2 USING THE BR CLUB LOYALTY PROGRAMME</p>
        <p>There are various benefits to joining the BR Club Loyalty Programme, which can include free services depending on the customer’s purchases, exclusive offers on BE RELAX products, and discounts at our partners. Members will be informed exclusively about our new offers via the website www.berelax.com, mobile app and newsletters. All the BR Club benefits are valid only in the Be Relax stores located at the following airports: Paris CDG, London LHR, Frankfurt FRA, Rome FCO, Dubai DBX, Baltimore BWI, New York JFK, Boston BOS, Detroit DTW, Washington Dulles IAD, San Diego SAN, Los Angeles LAX and Toronto YYZ.

        <li>No registration for this programme by mail or telephone will be considered.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This QR code will enable the Member to then go to the various points of sale forming part of the Loyalty Programme referred to in Article 3.1 of these Terms and Conditions, in order to benefit from the loyalty points. BE RELAX shop purchases made by the Member without mentioning to the personnel their membership of the Loyalty Programme at the time of the purchase shall not grant entitlement to loyalty points and shall not be registered on the Member’s profile.</p>
    <p>The calculation and the accumulation of the points are linked by the amount of the transaction carried out by the Customer. The BR Club programme operates independently of the former card-based loyalty programme. The latter is still accepted in the store provided that it is already initiated by a sticker representing a previous visit to a store. It can always be filled in incrementally during each store visit in order to earn the offers to be awarded for the 5th visit (5% discount) and the 10th visit (Be Up 10 or Express Manicure offered) as stipulated in its operation.</p>
   <p>Today, the two programmes can be mutually combined (e.g. a customer who has previously joined the loyalty cards can at any time join the new BR Club programme at the checkout or on the app while continuing to use his old loyalty card; he will continue to accumulate stickers on the loyalty card and he will also be able to accumulate points on his BR Club account automatically at each checkout). On the other hand, visits already accumulated in stickers on the loyalty card before joining the new BR Club programme, will never be transformed into points. The points award system is calculated based on the amount of purchases made. For more information on how the points award system works, please refer to the mobile website <a href='www.berelax.com'>www.berelax.com</a>.</p></div>
